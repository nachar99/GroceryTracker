# GroceryTracker

# This project tracks the inventory of a grocery store it gets the data from a txt file and gices the user 3 options to view it in diferrent ways
# Kept everything clean and organised by having 3 files main and .h and .cpp
# one way to enhance my code would be to get a file from the user and have my functions do it thing on that file instead of only having one permanent file
# the hardest thing was the problem solving part of it and I just broke everything down piece by piece to solve that
# how to write code that is reusable and utilizes functions and how to keep my code organized 
# I kept it thru adding a lot of comments so anyone after me can understand whats going on
